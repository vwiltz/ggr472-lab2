 GGR472 Lab 2
 Map displaying Toronto's neighbourhood boundaries and locations of TCHC housing.

 index.html is where my Lab 2 map can be found. demographics.html is for a map I was trying to create using data I'm working with on a different project but I'm having some issues getting it to display properly.

 Next to do: attempt to create a choropleth map visualizing a sociodemographic variable (at the neighbourhood level). This will likely involve data pre-processing in either Python or ArcGIS Pro since there is no census data at the neighbourhood level.
